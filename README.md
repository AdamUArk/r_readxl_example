How readxl missreads an xlsx file.

I am trying to download and read an xlsx file from 2016 Kansas State faculty counts.

https://www.k-state.edu/pa/faculty/demographics/total/index.html

When the tibble is created, some numbers do not match the original excel file.

I am reading the very last table in the excel sheet, with totals for each college.
